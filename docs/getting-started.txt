Install
=======

The Npgsql plugin is made available as `a Nuget package`_. Follow the
appropriate Nuget instructions to get the plugin installed.

.. CAUTION::

    For now, this plugin depends on a `fork`_ of the official `Npgsql
    project`_ to work. We are, however, working to get the necessary changes
    merged in upstream.

    Nuget will handle this for you.

.. SEEALSO::

    An `introduction to Nuget`_.

    Nuget instructions for `dotnet CLI`_ or `Visual Studio`_.

.. NOTE::

    If you're using a generic database program that can work with any ADO.NET
    provider but doesn't come with Npgsql or reference it directly, you can
    install Npgsql with the CrateDB plugin into your `Global Assembly Cache`_
    (GAC) with our custom `Npgsql Installer`_.

Next Steps
==========

Once the plugin is installed, you probably want to :ref:`connect to CrateDB
<connect>`.
