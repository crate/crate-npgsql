=====================
CrateDB Npgsql Plugin
=====================

|build-status| |docs|

A plugin for `Npgsql`_ that provides support for `CrateDB`_.

For now, this plugin depends on a `fork`_ of the official `Npgsql project`_ to
work. We are, however, working to get the necessary changes merged in upstream.

Contributing
============

This project is primarily maintained by `Crate.io`_, but we welcome community
contributions!

See the `developer docs`_ and the `contribution docs`_ for more information.
