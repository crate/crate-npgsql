=====================
CrateDB Npgsql Plugin
=====================

A `.NET`_ plugin for `Npgsql`_ that provides backwards compatibility support
for `CrateDB`_ versions 4.1.x and earlier. CrateDB versions 4.2 and later work
with Npgsql without the need for a plugin.

This plugin depends on a `fork`_ of the upstream Npgsql project to work. (Nuget
will handle this for you.)

Contributing
============

This project is primarily maintained by `Crate.io`_, but we welcome community
contributions!

See the `developer docs`_ and the `contribution docs`_ for more information.
